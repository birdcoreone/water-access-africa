# 🌍 Water Access in Africa - Data Pipeline and Visualization Project

This project is a comprehensive data pipeline and analysis initiative aimed at understanding and improving water access across African communities. It leverages **SQL for data cleaning and analysis**, **Power BI for visualization**, and **Python for advanced analytics (future phase)**. The project tracks water sources, population access, queue times, and infrastructure development progress.

---

## 📊 Project Phases

This repository is divided into multiple phases, representing the full lifecycle of data-driven analysis:

### 1️⃣ SQL - Data Preparation & Analysis
- **Schema design** for water access database
- **Data cleaning and transformations**
- **Analytical queries** to extract insights (e.g., population with basic access, pollution rates, queue times)

📂 Located in: `sql/`

### 2️⃣ Data Visualization (Power BI & DAX)
- **Interactive dashboards** created in Power BI
- Insights into water source quality, population served, and project progress
- **Advanced DAX measures** for calculations like percentage of population with access, queue time impacts, and project cost tracking

📂 Located in: `data-viz/`

### 3️⃣ Python (Planned Phase)
- Advanced **predictive modeling** (e.g., forecasting water shortages)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) scripts
- Automated reporting using Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib

📂 To be added in: `python/`
