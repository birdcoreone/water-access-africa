# SQL Phase - Water Access in Africa

## Overview
This phase of the project focuses on analyzing water access in Africa using SQL. It involves data preparation, cleaning, and executing queries to extract meaningful insights.

## Folder Structure
```
sql/
├── Data/             # Folder for raw and cleaned datasets (if needed)
├── Queries/         # Folder for SQL scripts (cleaning, analysis, etc.)
├── Results/         # Folder for exported query results
├── README.md        # Documentation for SQL phase
```

## Contents
- **Data/**: Contains raw datasets and any preprocessed data used for analysis.
- **Queries/**: Includes SQL scripts for:
  - Data cleaning
  - Data transformation
  - Analysis queries to extract insights
- **Results/**: Stores query outputs such as reports, tables, or CSV exports.

## Steps
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Load the datasets into a database.
   - Verify and clean the data to remove inconsistencies.

2. **SQL Queries**
   - Execute cleaning scripts to ensure data integrity.
   - Run analysis queries to gain insights into water accessibility.

3. **Exporting Results**
   - Save and document key findings for visualization in later phases.

## Database & Tools
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Tools Used:** MySQL Workbench

## How to Use
1. Place raw datasets into the `Data/` folder.
2. Run the scripts in `Queries/` to clean and analyze the data.
3. Export results and save them in the `Results/` folder.

## Next Steps
After completing the SQL phase, the next step involves data visualization using Power BI and DAX.
